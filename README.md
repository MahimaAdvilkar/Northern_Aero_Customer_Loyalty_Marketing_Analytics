## 🎯 Objectives

- Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) by segment  
- Simulate scenarios with/without loyalty program  
- Optimize loyalty program spending using the ZENITH strategy  
- Evaluate strategic investments for long-term customer retention

## 📊 Data Overview

- **Total Members**: 58,000  
- **Segments**: Platinum, Gold, Silver, Inactive, Lost  
- **Data Points**:
  - Transition probabilities  
  - Yield per segment  
  - Loyalty program cost per customer  
  - Gross margin contributions  
  - Discount rate modeling

## 🧮 Key Analysis

### ✅ CLV Modeling at 15% Discount Rate

> Platinum Top 20% CLV ≈ $3,495  
> Total Program Value (with Loyalty): $14.2M  
> Value without Loyalty Program: $8.5M  
> ➕ Net Gain: $5.7M

> Value drops to ~$8.9M  
> Yet, Top Tier customers still preserve high ROI

## 🛠 ZENITH Strategy Optimization

We restructured loyalty spending by:
- Doubling investment in **Top 20% Platinum and Gold**
- Reducing/eliminating spend on **Low-value Silver & Inactive**
- Reallocating Silver segment spend
- Keeping budget nearly constant: $703K vs $661K
